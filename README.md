I'm Scott Banducci and I believe the key to success is 90% hard work and 10% intelligence.

My core values are honesty, integrity and dedication to my work and to the folks I work with.

I earned a Bachelor's degree studying politics and philosophy at UBC in 2011 and I'm currently completing a 2nd Bachelor's degree in computer science.

Before returning to university I built a Business Develoment career working for B2B software, technology, process automation companies. I have international business experience having worked in Toronto, Sydney and London. I was consistently offered promotions or full time positions due to my exceptional performance.

Great opporunities often come from very unexpected places so please don't hesitate to connect with me for a conversation. You can message me at: https://www.linkedin.com/in/scott-banducci-65042a26
