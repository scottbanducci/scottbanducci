I'm Scott Banducci and I believe the key to success is 90% hard work and 10% intelligence. And I'm likely overestimating the importance of intelligence.

My core values are honesty, integrity and dedication to the job and to the people I work with.

I earned a Bachelor's degree studying politics and philosophy at UBC in 2011 and I'm currently completing a 2nd Bachelor's degree in computer science.

Before returning to university I built a Business Develoment career working for B2B software, technology, process automation companies. I've worked in Toronto, Sydney and London and was consistently offered promotions or full time positions due to my exceptional performance.

Great opporunities often come from very unexpected places so please don't hesitate to connect with me for a conversation. You can email me message me at: https://www.linkedin.com/in/scott-banducci-65042a26
